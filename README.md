# uplifting-trance-melody-generator


Here's a step-by-step plan to help you get started:

1. **Research and Gather MIDI Dataset**:
   - Look for MIDI files of existing uplifting trance melodies. Websites like MIDIworld and MIDI Database are good places to start.
   - Ensure that the MIDI files cover a variety of scales, chord progressions, and melodies to provide a diverse dataset for training.

2. **Preprocessing MIDI Files**:
   - Write Python code to parse the MIDI files and extract relevant musical information such as notes, durations, velocities, and scales.
   - Convert the MIDI data into a suitable format for training your model. You might represent each note as a numerical value or one-hot encode them.

3. **Designing the Model**:
   - Decide on the architecture of your melody generation model. A recurrent neural network (RNN) or a transformer-based model like GPT could be suitable for this task.
   - Consider using libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch for building and training your model.
   - Define input/output sequences for your model. For example, input sequences could be a series of notes, and the output would be the next note in the melody.

4. **Training the Model**:
   - Split your dataset into training and validation sets.
   - Train your model on the training dataset and monitor its performance using the validation set.
   - Experiment with different hyperparameters, architectures, and training techniques to improve model performance.

5. **Generating Melodies**:
   - Once your model is trained, implement a function to generate new melodies.
   - Provide options for users to specify parameters like scale, tempo, and length of the melody.
   - Use the trained model to predict the next notes in the melody sequence based on the input parameters.

6. **Evaluating and Refining**:
   - Evaluate the generated melodies to ensure they meet the criteria of uplifting trance music.
   - Solicit feedback from users or music experts to refine your model and improve the quality of generated melodies.
   - Consider incorporating techniques like reinforcement learning to fine-tune the model based on feedback.

7. **Deployment and Sharing**:
   - Once you're satisfied with the performance of your model, consider deploying it as a web application or a standalone tool.
   - Share your project on platforms like GitHub so that others can learn from and contribute to your work.

Remember to document your code thoroughly and keep track of your progress as you work on each step of the project. Good luck, and have fun creating uplifting trance melodies with Python!
